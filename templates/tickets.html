<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>Tickets can be registered

<a href="https://ticket.hsbp.org/camppp7e1">in our ticketing system</a>
and are <strong>required to participate</strong> at the event &ndash; even
for speakers and/or organizers. <strong>Registration is free</strong> and
submitting personal information	is not required. Payment is done on your
last day of participation, which is 1/n-th of the total costs of the camp,
where n is the number of participants.

Every piece of information you submit to our ticketing system will be destroyed by
the end of the event.</p>

<p>Although registration requires no personal data to be entered, <!-- we have
an <a href="https://ticket.hsbp.org:42443/camppp7e0">SSL-protected interface</a>.
We don't believe in the commercial CA system, so you have two options to verify
the integrity of the HTTPS connection. --> you can <!-- either install the
<a href="http://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=3">CAcert root certificate</a>
and/or --> verify the <a href="https://ticket.hsbp.org/cert">checksum of the certificate</a>
signed by a subset of the organizers using PGP.</p>
